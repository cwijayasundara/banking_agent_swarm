        "# Learn how to build your own Multi-Agent Fundamental Analysis Workflow with LlamaIndex\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agents\n",
        "By leveraging on AgentWorflow class from LlamaIndex, we'll create a multi-agent system composed of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A fundamental_agent: Responsible for collecting ratios for a given ticker using the FinanceToolkit package\n",
        "\n",
        "- A profitability_agent: Responsible for gathering profitability ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) and analyzing their strengths or weaknesses compared to given thresholds. For example, if ROA > 5%, the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A liquidity_agent: This agent collects liquidity ratios for a given ticker (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) and comments on these ratios given a set of threshold values. For example if Current Ratio is between 1.5-3.0 the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A supervisor_agent: This agent provides a final comment on the overall health of the firm based on the different comments coming from the different agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "I've limited my agents to 2 specialized ones, you can add as much as you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent's Breakdown:\n",
        "Then for each agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A clear description of the goal of the agent was provided\n",
        "\n",
        "- A system prompt of the agent's instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Tool (you can also provide several tools) that helps gathering the data needed and compare it to the set of the pre-defined thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The next agent to take the handoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools\n",
        "There are 4 tools, each agent has a tool. Each tool can act and modify the State of the multi-agent system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## AgentWorkflow\n",
        "Finally, the AgentWorkflow class puts all these together:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You list the agents to use\n",
        "\n",
        "- You specify the agent root\n",
        "\n",
        "- You initiate your state\n",
        "\n",
        "## LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "I used GPT-4o and compare it to the latest model of OpenAI GPT-4.5-preview.\n",
        "(I've used function calling because these agents supports natively tool calling).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- The workflow is easy to put in place\n",
        "- The agent's breakdown is well-defined, from its description to the system prompt and the next agents for handoff.\n",
        "- I called LLMs inside of the tools to provide insights on the ratios compared to the thresholds. Otherwise, I faced sometimes some hallucination...\n",
        "- The final answer from GPT-4.5-preview is well-structured compared to GPT-4o, providing key ratios, values, comments, and overall insights."

            "  Output: Liquidity ratios extracted and Comments performed: To analyze the financial health of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) based on its profitability ratios, we will evaluate each ratio against the provided thresholds, assign scores, and provide justifications for those scores. \n",

            "### 1. Current Ratio\n",
            "- **Value:** 4.4399\n",
            "- **Score:** 5/10\n",
            "- **Justification:** The current ratio of 4.4399 is significantly above the healthy range of 1.5 - 3.0, indicating that NVDA has excess cash or current assets relative to its current liabilities. While a high current ratio can suggest strong liquidity, it may also indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate revenue. Therefore, it receives a middle score of 5, as it is not in the warning or risky zone but is also not optimal for operational efficiency.\n",
            "\n",

            "- **Justification:** The quick ratio of 3.6724 is well above the healthy threshold of >1.0, indicating that NVDA can cover its current liabilities without relying on inventory sales. This suggests strong liquidity and financial stability. The score of 8 reflects a solid position, although it is still somewhat high, which could imply underutilization of liquid assets.\n",

            "- **Score:** 9/10\n",
            "- **Justification:** The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.1258 is well below the healthy range of 0.3 - 1.5, indicating that NVDA is under-leveraged. This low ratio suggests that the company is not heavily reliant on debt to finance its operations, which is a positive sign for financial stability and risk management. The score of 9 reflects a very healthy financial structure, although being under-leveraged could also mean missed opportunities for growth through debt financing.\n",

            "- **Justification:** The interest coverage ratio of 337.3158 is significantly above the healthy threshold of >3.0, indicating that NVDA can easily cover its interest expenses with its earnings. This extremely high ratio suggests that the company is in an excellent position to manage its debt obligations, reflecting strong profitability and financial health. The score of 10 indicates exceptional performance in this area.\n",

            "  - The debt-to-equity ratio indicates a conservative approach to leverage, minimizing financial risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Weaknesses:**\n",
            "  - The current ratio, while indicating liquidity, is excessively high, which may suggest inefficiencies in asset utilization.\n",

            "### Conclusion\n",
            "Overall, NVDA appears to be in a strong financial position, with robust liquidity and minimal debt. The company is well-equipped to handle its financial obligations, but it may benefit from optimizing its asset utilization to enhance operational efficiency. The scores reflect a generally healthy firm, with a focus on maintaining its strengths while addressing potential inefficiencies.\n",
